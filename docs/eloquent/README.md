## Eloquent relathionships




## Polymorphic relathionships

Since Twill CMS uses polymorphic relathionships for some of the models, we can also uses their relations to show specific fields in response.

They achived this trough `Traits`, and some of the models have behaviour traits for polymorphic relathionships.
