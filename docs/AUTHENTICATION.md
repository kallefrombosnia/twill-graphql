### Authentication & security :lock:

To create auth based queries and mutations you should follow the Lighthouse concept.

Lighthouse directives:
*   [@auth](https://lighthouse-php.com/master/api-reference/directives.html#auth)
*   [@can](https://lighthouse-php.com/master/api-reference/directives.html#can)
*   [@guard](https://lighthouse-php.com/master/api-reference/directives.html#guard)

Those directives provides us very easy way to protect our routes trough standard Laravel authentication method.


Best way to get the idea of implementation is to check their section for [Security](https://lighthouse-php.com/master/security/authentication.html).
