# Mutations

Mutations are actions on Laravel Models: create, update, upsert, delete.

In this package we cover 2 type of mutations for Twill CMS. First one is using modules which can mix Twill additional features like files, medias.  
Second one is direct usage of mutations to interact with the Twill CMS features directly.
